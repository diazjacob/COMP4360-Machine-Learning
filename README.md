# COMP4360 Machine Learning
 This is a repository holding all my machine learning work for COMP4360, the course consisted of a midterm and a final with a 40/60 split. This course went over all the fundamental ideas behind machine learning including perceptrons, gradient descent learning, hyperparameters, RBFs and basis functions in general, multivariate statistics, sphereing data, the Euclidean vs. Melanobois distance metric, and more
 
 I went into this course with a solid background in multivariable calculus and AI theory, so it went quite smooth for me. I am particularly proud of this work because I was able to secure an A+ in this course. Please feel free to read over the ML_FINAL documents for an ideas as to the breadth of the course materials!
